Once you are done, commit and push your work.  
Then checkout the branch of the next level.

merge your changes from `level_3`  

`git merge level_3`  

_a commit message may appear, save and quit the commit message editor_  

review your `build_arrays.js` file again, did your changes merge in properly?  
if it did, continue the assignment by following the comments.
